# Solving-Differentials
Not sure I'd complete but this is for fun and aid my understanding :):)
## Why I'm doing this 
Finally understood differentials and want to cement my understanding ???? not so sure though 
but here is a snippet(`header file`) tho of the code hopefully as time goes on I'd put in codes to actually solve them
### Code Snippet
```C++
#ifndef DIFFERENTIALS_H
#define DIFFERENTIALS_H

#include <string>

// Function declarations
void analyzeSingleVariable();
void analyzeMultivariable();
void analyzeEquation();

#endif // DIFFERENTIALS_H
```
